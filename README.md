# Crime-Pattern-analysis-and-Prediction
In this paper we aim at analysing the data for different crimes happening in different states over a period of 10 years.
We arranged the data in time series format to learn about the patterns of the crime instances and then applied three regression formulas on the training set. 
The algorithm which gave us the maximum R^2 value was used for predicitng the data of the test set of the data.

# Crime-Pattern-analysis-and-Prediction
In this paper we aim at analysing the data for different crimes happening in different states over a period of 10 years.
The data was arranged in sliding window format to apply time series analysis on the data. Three algorithms were applied to the training set, namely Regression Decision Tree, Support Vector Regression and Random Forest Regression.
The algorithm which gave us the maximum R^2 value was used for prediciting the values of the test set of the data.
